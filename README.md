# Project Update: Implemented Feedback Changes

In response to the feedback, several critical improvements have been made to the project. Firstly, the application has been updated to target .NET Framework 4.8 and necessary references have been added. Error handling has been enhanced to manage null values, incorrect value types, and to display appropriate error messages to the user. The layout has been improved by adding sufficient spacing between input and output sections, and incorporating lines to better organize the UI. Advanced features, such as coloured text in the display, have been utilized to enhance user experience. A reset function has been implemented to revert scaled recipes back to their original values, and users are prompted to confirm before clearing any data. To adhere to coding standards, separator lines have been added between methods, an end-of-file line has been included, comments have been made more meaningful, and classes have been split into separate files for better organization.
